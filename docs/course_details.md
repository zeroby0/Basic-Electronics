# Course details

Exams
-----
There will be two exams: MidTerm and a Final Exam. All Mid-Term exams are tentatively scheduled on October 3 to 8. Final exams are tentatively scheduled on first week of December. The exams will test your practical knowledge on developing, simulating a circuit asked or given to you.

Experiments
-----------
There will be atleast 9 experiments. The students involvement and completion of the experiments will be judged. Once completed, the student will demonstrate the experiment to the instructor or lab-incharge. The instructor may ask to modify the experiment accordingly and will expect a clear justification on the behavior of the modified circuit to give points.

Textbook
--------
The textbook Introduction to Electronics circuits by Richard Dorf and James Svoboda is recommended. Students are also recommended to refer The art of electronics by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, which is available in IIIT-B library.

Lab reports and assignments
---------------------------
Students with their lab patners will write lab reports which will include only plots of the experiments performed in the lab.
The lab reports will be graded on the presentation of the data. Students are encouraged to use either Matlab, gnuplot, Libreoffice or MS Excel softwares to plot the data. _Incomplete data with no legends, labels will be rejected._

Quizzes and Assignments
-----------------------
Lab quizzes be held almost in every week, thereby no prior information will be given to you. Assignments will be given intermittently to get more practice.

Final Project
-------------
Students in group of four can work on a project. The students are encouraged to start working on their project after their midterm exam. The project will test the group of students skills on electronics. The project should be demonstrated to the instructor in the last week of the semester. The project submission involves poster, video, and source-code if any by the last week of the semester.
